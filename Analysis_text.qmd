## INTRODUCTION

Latin America was a region that began to successfully democratize at the end of the 20th century. This fate awaited her despite the extremely high income inequality. The topic of inequality is extremely controversial in terms of its impact on democratization. The topic of this paper will be to identify the impact of income inequality on the level of democratization in Latin American countries. Has democratization been made possible by inequality? Or are there any other factors that contribute to democratization despite the high level of inequality? After statistical analysis, an assessment of the degree of influence of both the main variable under study (inequality) and the effect of control variables will be given.

# LITERATURE REVIEW

The relationship between income inequality and democracy is a subject of extensive academic debate, with scholars expressing different opinions. Ansell and Samuels (2007) assert that increasing inequality can promote democratization by enabling emerging social groups to advocate for institutional changes. Conversely, Burkhart (2007) argues that inequality frequently intensifies political inequalities, which could threaten democratic institutions. In addition, Acemoglu et al (2006) argue that in countries with high income inequality a rich elite will struggle against democratization more intensely, as potential call for redistributive policies under democratic regime will result in substantial economic loss for the former. In Krauss (2014) a third point of view is expressed. He claims that existing methodology and complexity of societies make it impossible to identify the real influence of inequality on democracy. It could be inferred that while some scholars view income inequality as a democratizing force under specific conditions, while others highlight its destabilizing effects or suggest that democratization hinges on broader historical and economic contexts rather than inequality itself. In other words, there is no consensus in academic community on this issue. It seems it would be interesting to analyze what are the relations between income inequality and democracy in Latin American regional context.
